# Julia Conditional Logic Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to conditional logic (`if`, `elseif`, `else`) in Julia. The primary issue is that implicit type coercion in conditions can have unintended consequences, leading to unexpected behavior or incorrect function outputs if the conditions are not precisely defined.

The `bug.jl` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.jl` provides the corrected version.  Understanding this subtle behavior can help prevent similar errors in other Julia programs.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.jl` using a Julia interpreter.
3. Observe the unexpected output.
4. Compare with the corrected output in `bugSolution.jl`.

## Solution
The solution involves explicitly handling all possible cases within the conditional statements to avoid ambiguity and type coercion related issues.  See `bugSolution.jl` for details.
